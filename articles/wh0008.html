Tonight, residents of apartment 404 have organized an intervention for their roommate, who, according to a key witness, has been particularly possessive over his 2% milk as of late. The roommate in question, Stanley Schultz, is becoming infamous among room 404 occupants for buying excessive quantities of the bone-strengthening liquid. “One time, he brought home 3 jugs of milk from the store. I asked him why he needed so much milk. I thought the question was innocent enough, but instead of answering he just hissed at me,” recounted a roommate. After this incident, Schultz quickly stored the milk in the fridge and sprinted to his room.</p>
<p>
“If Stanley actually drank any milk, or even just let us have some every once in awhile, I wouldn’t have a problem with it,” he explained. “But he just lets it sit in the fridge until it goes bad. And he always puts up a fight when one of us finally dumps it down the sink.” After this milk fiasco had occurred for two consecutive months, residents of the apartment had seen enough.</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to put an end to this. He’s gone too far this time,” said the organizer of the intervention, who has requested to remain anonymous. “We can't just let him run amuck, letting his purchases go to waste like this. It also takes up our fridge space and smells pretty awful.” After the milky matter had been discussed with the other roommates, it was unanimous that intervention was necessary.</p>
<p>
If you’re an avid reader of the Local Happenings section of this fine news platform, you may recall that as his roommate, I can personally attest to Schultz’s terrible deeds in his short time living here. But to keep this recount unbiased, I’ll close this story with a question. If your roommates bought milk and let it spoil, how would you feel? Obviously you’d be pretty mad. Fuck, It’s not really unbiased anymore. Whatever, I hate this guy.</p>
