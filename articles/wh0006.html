The recently-released box office mega-hit, Dune, has received criticism online for its deceptive marketing. After a drawn out campaign for the movie, which heavily featured the mega-star Zendaya, fans of the Shake It Up alumni were ecstatic to see her in the film. Trailers and set leaks of Zendaya in her Dune attire garnered thousands of likes and hundreds of comments, all along the line of  “Yasss, Zendaya is so badass, can’t wait to see Dune!”</p>
<p>
Timothy Chalamet, the other star of this new release, did not receive nearly as much excitement from his fans when announcing his role in the new sci-fi movie. A photo, containing a picture of him and Zendaya on the set of Dune, and captioned, “Guys! I’m in Dune too! Can’t wait for this movie to come out!” received a bleak 200 likes on Twitter. </p>
<p>
On October 22nd, Zendaya fans flooded theatres to see their favorite actress in the dystopian sci-fi movie that had been in their feeds for months. Fans were beyond disappointed, however, to see that despite the movie posters, trailers, celebrity advertisements, Vogue photoshoots, and red carpet premieres, Zendaya appeared on screen for a mere 7 minutes at the end of the movie.</p>
<p>
Angered by such severe clickbait, fans turned to Twitter in their fits of rage. One Twitter user, @ZenBaeA, passionately journaled their disappointment in 280 words or less, “I CANNOT F*CKING BELIEVE THAT I WALKED INTO THAT THEATRE EXPECTING 2 & ½ HOURS OF GOLDEN ZENDAYA BLISS. INSTEAD, I GOT REJECTED WHITE BOY OF THE MONTH, TIMONTHY CHAMPAGNE OR WHATEVER THE HELL HIS NAME IS.”</p>
				<p>Perhaps even more angered after the release, however, was Timothee Chalamet himself. In a rather heated Facebook Live session, Chalamet went on a long rant about his frustrations with the movie, the advertisement, and the attention his co-star has received. A transcript of an excerpt of his outburst has been provided by one of the 10 fans that witnessed it live. </p>
<p>“Would you guys please, for the love of God, stop calling her my co-star? She was in 7-fucking minutes of the movie! 7 Minutes!” As Timothy continued to express his frustration, the live chat began to fill up with comments supporting their queen. “Can the entire world forget about goddamn Zendaya for one goddamn minute! Ever since she started dating Tom Holland, it’s been Zendaya this, Zendaya that! I’m sick of it!” Sensing his rising anger, fans began to flood his chat with increasingly poor attempts to spell his name. Ranging from “Timothee Champagne” to “Kimberly Chardonnay,” the heckling brought tears to his eyes and finally sent him into hysterics. Before the livestream ended, fans recall him repeating his name between sobs.</p>
				<p>Since his online tantrum, Chalamet has turned into a meme of his own design. His face being featured as the brunt of jokes on several subreddits and his angered screams weaponized as the most popular sound on TikTok, Chalamet has seemed to finally obtain the fame he was after. Unfortunately, Chalamet has not yet responded to his new popularity, as his social media rights have been revoked by his agent. Perhaps with a little luck, Chalamet will receive the attention he so desperately craves (and the fans more than 7 minutes of Zendaya), in the highly anticipated second part to Dune, set to be released in 2023.</p>
